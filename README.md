Antique code of use to nobody.

Projects:

ipxfer4: 

  IPXFer version 4.01: This was a dos utility for transfering files over an IPX network. The design included a server (sendnet4) capable of handling 10 client connections from the recnet4 client. This utility was originally released as shareware. The shareware limitation code was removed before it was released to this repo.

doomutils\bspcomp:

  A BSP compliler for DOOM implemented in Borland Pascal 7

doomutils\snapshot:

  A screen capture TSR (terminate and stay resident) program used to capture the rendering process of the DOOM engine. This utility was created long before the DOOM source code was released and was used to capture images of how the engine was rendering frames to video memory. In the early to mid 90's, the inner workings of software like DOOM was much harder to reverse engineer but was still a facination to many programmers and hobbyists. This was just a utilty created to aid in the understanding of how the engine worked.
